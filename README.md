# Application Overview

## Objective  
This app is designed to empower users with three essential features that boost both networking knowledge and security:

1. **IP Geolocation**: Pinpoint the exact geographical location of any IP address, whether for cybersecurity research or pure curiosity. Get instant access to detailed location information.
2. **Port Scanning**: Scan hosts for open ports, uncover potential security vulnerabilities, or find the active services running on a system. Think of it as a digital detective providing in-depth insights into your network.
   > **Important Note**: Port scanning can only be performed within the same network. Scanning devices outside your local network is not supported by this feature.
3. **Password Generator/Encryption**: Create strong, random passwords and encrypt sensitive data securely. Ensure your accounts and data are well-protected with robust encryption, offering peace of mind.

## Summary  
This application unites three powerful tools into one seamless platform. Trace IP addresses, scan networks for vulnerabilities, and generate/encrypt passwordsâ€”all in one place. By blending networking diagnostics and encryption features, this app provides a holistic approach to cybersecurity. Whether you're an IT professional or just someone who values online security, this app is your trusted digital safeguard.
