# Application Overview

## Objective  
This app is designed to empower users with three essential features that boost both networking knowledge and security:

1. **IP Geolocation**: Pinpoint the exact geographical location of any IP address, whether for cybersecurity research or pure curiosity. Get instant access to detailed location information.
2. **Port Scanning**: Scan hosts for open ports, uncover potential security vulnerabilities, or find the active services running on a system. Think of it as a digital detective providing in-depth insights into your network.
   > **Important Note**: Port scanning can only be performed within the same network. Scanning devices outside your local network is not supported by this feature.
3. **Password Generator/Encryption**: Create strong, random passwords and encrypt sensitive data securely. Ensure your accounts and data are well-protected with robust encryption, offering peace of mind.

## Summary  
This application unites three powerful tools into one seamless platform. Trace IP addresses, scan networks for vulnerabilities, and generate/encrypt passwordsâ€”all in one place. By blending networking diagnostics and encryption features, this app provides a holistic approach to cybersecurity. Whether you're an IT professional or just someone who values online security, this app is your trusted digital safeguard.

### 2. IP Geolocation Screen  

**Discover IP Details**  
This feature enables users to retrieve detailed information about an IP address. It's a powerful tool for gaining insights into geographical and network-specific data.  

| **IP Geolocation** |  
| ------------------- |  
| <img src="Image\ipgeo.png" alt="IP Geolocation Screen" width="200"/> |  

#### API Used  
We utilize the **IP Geolocation API** from [RapidAPI](https://rapidapi.com/xakageminato/api/ip-geolocation-ipwhois-io) for accurate and real-time information.  

| <img src="Image\Api-ip.png" alt="API Integration for IP Geolocation" width="800"/> |  

**Example Information Provided:**  

- Country, Region, City, Latitude, Longitude, ISP

### 3. Port Scanning  

**Note**: This port scanning feature only works within the same network, whether the network is physical or virtual. It does not support scanning devices outside your local network.

| **Port Scanning ** |  
| ------------------- |  
| <img src="Image\port.png" alt="IP Geolocation Screen" width="200"/> | 

This page allows users to perform a **port scan** on a given IP address. It checks common ports like SSH (22), HTTP (80), HTTPS (443), and more to identify which are open.  

- **Input an IP Address**: Type the IP address you want to scan.  
- **Scan Ports**: Press the button to start scanning.  
- **View Results**: Displays open ports and their corresponding services.  

If no open ports are found, a message will let you know.  


**this was tested on a real server with open ports**

### 4. Password Encryption  

**Secure Your Passwords**  
Easily encrypt your passwords using one of two methods:  
- **ROT13**: A simple and reversible cipher   
- **SHA-1**: A cryptographic hash function for stronger, one-way encryption.  

| **Password Encryption** |  
| ------------------------ |  
| <img src="Image\password.png" alt="Password Encryption Screen" width="200"/> |  

This feature is perfect for enhancing password security and ensuring privacy.
